        		       	    	<p>An interview is at the most fundamental level, a meeting between strangers.
									It is worth bearing this in mind at all times when you are preparing for an
									interview. You have a very limited amount of time to make a good
										impression, so preparation is key.An interview should be a two way process, but in reality, particularly early
 on in your career, it can often feel that all the power is in the hands of the
interviewer. It can feel like you, as the candidate, are being judged and weighed in the balance,
whereas an interview really should be a two way process. You need to be sure the job and the
organisation is right for you too. Thinking about an interview like this may help reduce the fear
factor. It is true to say that most people get nervous at interviews and find them pretty stressful,
however many you have attended, but, by finding out a little more and being better prepared, it
is possible to improve your confidence levels and interview performance markedly. </p>
<h1><a name="How to dress for an interview">How to dress for an interview</a></h1>
        		       	   	                 <p>Before you say a single word to the interviewer, you have already made an impression based on how you’re dressed.
 	The guidelines given here are commonly accepted as appropriate for interviewing. 
	Every company has a different dress code; how you dress at the job may have very little to do with how you dress for an interview.</p>
									
									
<h2>men</h2>
  
  <ul> <p> 
   <li>Dress in a manner that is professionally appropriate to the position for which you are applying. In almost all cases, this means wearing a suit. </li>
   <li>You should wear a suit to interviews. “Suit” means the works: a matching jacket and pants, dress shirt, tie</li>								
   <li>Your suit should be comfortable and fit you well so that you look and act your best. There is a difference between not yet feeling at ease in a suit and trying to fit into the same suit you wore to your sister’s wedding when you were 15. (In the latter case, it’s time to invest in a new suit!)</li>
   <li>Avoid loud colors and flashy ties.</li>
   <li>Clothing should be neat, clean, and pressed. If you don’t have an iron, either buy one or be prepared to visit the dry-cleaner’s often.</li>
   <li>Shower or bathe the morning of the interview. Wear deodorant.</li>
   <li>Don’t wear cologne or aftershave. You don’t want to smell overpowering or worse, cause an allergic reaction.</li>
   <li> Make sure you have fresh breath.</li>
   <li>Brush your teeth before you leave for the interview, and don’t eat before the interview. Don’t smoke right before an interview.</li>
   <li>Your hair should be neat, clean, and conservative.</li></p>

	<p>While it may be appropriate to dress more casually for a second interview, 
	you must still dress professionally. It’s much better to be too dressed up than too casual. A good rule of thumb 
	is to dress like your boss. Shoes should be well-polished and in good condition, not scuffed or run-down at the heels. 
	They should also match your belt. You will get a great deal of use out of a good-quality pair of dress shoes in a traditional style.
 	Ask the salesperson at the shoe store for advice. Be sure to shave the morning of the interview, even if you don’t ordinarily shave every day.
 	If you have a full beard or moustache it should be trimmed and neat-looking.This may sound like a lot of rules,
 	but these are the generally acceptable guidelines you should follow when deciding what to wear to an interview. 
	Dressing professionally shows respect for yourself, the interviewer, and the company. 
	You may not have to dress like this every day, but you are more likely to be taken seriously when you present
 	yourself in a professional manner and take the time to attend to details.</p>
    							<h2>Women </h2>
    <p>Generally, you should wear a suit with a skirt or pants.  When in doubt, be more conservative.
     Your suit should be comfortable and fit you well; if your waistband is cutting you in half or your jacket is too tight, you won’t look or act your best.
    Some stores offer free alterations when you purchase a suit, or you may want to find a tailor to adjust a suit you already own.
    Interview suits should be simple and dark in color. Anything tight, bright, short, or sheer should absolutely be avoided. 
    (Interviewers have been known to complain about the length of interviewees’ skirts; if you have any doubts, it’s probably too short.)
     Knee-length skirts are suggested. Very long skirts, while modest, are also considered too trendy for an interview.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Wear a conservative blouse with your suit. Do not wear bright colors, animal prints, or anything lacy, sheer, or low-cut.</li>
    <li>Make-up and nail polish should be understated and flattering; shades that are neutral to your skin tone are generally advisable. Avoid bright or unusual colors or very long nails.</li>
    <li>Keep your jewelry and hair accessories to a minimum, and stick to those that are not flashy, distracting, or shiny. One ring per hand is best.</li>
    <li>Shoes should be conservative and fairly low-heeled. They should be in reasonably good condition, not scuffed or run-down at the heels. Don’t wear shoes with an open toe or back; any shoes you would wear on a date or to a club are probably inappropriate. A basic pump is flattering, versatile, and will stay in style forever (once you own pumps, you can spend the rest of your money on fun shoes). The salesperson in the shoe store can steer you in the right direction.</li>
    <li>Your hose should be neutral (matched to your skin tone). Make sure the heels are not dyed black from your shoes and that there are no snags or runs. Only use the nail polish trick in an emergency; you may want to carry an extra pair of hose with you instead.</li>
    <li>Dress in a manner that is professionally appropriate to the position for which you are applying. In almost all cases, this means wearing a suit. It is rarely appropriate to “dress down” for an interview, regardless of company dress code policy. When in doubt, go conservative (is this starting to sound familiar?).</li>
    <li>Your clothing should always be neat, clean, and pressed. If you don’t have an iron, either buy one or be prepared to visit the dry-cleaner’s often.</li>
    <li>Shower or bathe the morning of the interview. Wear deodorant. Don’t wear perfume: you don’t want to smell overpowering or worse, cause an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have fresh breath. Brush your teeth before you leave for the interview, and don’t eat or smoke before the interview.</li>
    <li>Your hair should be neat, clean, and conservatively styled. Banana clips, brightly-colored scrunchies or elastics, and cheerleader-type ponytails look out of place with a suit. You may want to wear your hair in an updo, pull it back into a low ponytail, or wear a barrette (this suggestion does not include the tiny little barrettes that only hold the front of your bangs back). The idea is to look polished and professional, not to advertise what a creative genius your hairdresser is.</li></ul>

        		       	   	     <p>Maintain professional speech whenever you are talking about anything personal.
Don't go into too much detail if talking about yourself, spending only around one minute doing so. Try to relate personal details to the requirements of the job. When you discuss any personal topics, you can relate them to skills that are relevant to the position you are interviewing for. This will allow you to express both your personality and illustrate your skills and experience.

    You could talk about how you taught yourself a language or instrument to illustrate that you can learn new skills and techniques.
    Discussing how you helped organize a community event can exemplify your leadership skills.

        		       	   	      <p><h2>Interview do's</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dress appropriately. Extremes in fashion or very casual clothes should generally be avoided. Look neat and clean.</li>
    <li>Be punctual. Make sure that you are 10 minutes early and if you are going to be unavoidably detained ring and let them know.</li>
    <li>Express yourself and your views clearly.</li>
    <li>Bring a copy of all relevant documents, so you can refer to them if necessary.</li>
    <li>Listen carefully to the questions and answer clearly and thoughtfully.</li>
    <li>Make eye-contact. Remember to talk to the person (not the top right hand corner of the room or at their shoes).</li>
    <li>Make sure you fully understand the question and query any point about which you may be doubtful.</li>
    <li>If you are being interviewed by a panel, ensure that you direct your answer to the person who asked the question, while still including the other interviewers by making brief eye contact.</li>
    <li>Ask questions. Selection is a two way process. They select you, but you also select them.</li>
    <li>Be aware of what your needs are, so as you can assess how well the company can fulfil them.</li>
    <li>Be Confident. Remember that you applied for the position because you thought that you could do it.</li></ul>

   <li> Don't fidget or twitch, try to control other nervous mannerisms.</li>
    <li>Don't interrupt the interviewer before they have finished asking you a question and never finish their sentences for them.</li>
    <li>Don't Lie.</li>
    <li>Don't worry if you answer one question badly.</li>
    <li>Don't talk about salary, holidays or bonuses unless they bring them up.</li>
    <li>Don't answer questions with a simple "yes" or "no". Make sure that you explain your reasoning fully.</li>
